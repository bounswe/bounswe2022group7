### Responsibilities

- I am a member of the backend team. I worked on research and implementation, and also debugging. 

### Main Contributions

I started to work on dockerization issue of backend and database. I researched about this topic and started to work on the structure. We finished and concluded this part successfully with Erkin. Before starting the project we decided to use Kotlin with Sprin Boot and MySql. I had no previous experienced with Kotlin. Hence, I researched about it and also took guide from other members of backend team about implementation. After this research and with this guidance, I implemented classes related to sign up/log in functions and home page. Also, implemented one endpoint about art items and a few endpoints to create data to database.

### Responsibilities

- I was the communicator of the team and I was responsible for communications with the TA.
- I am a member of the frontend team. I worked on research and implementation.

### Main Contributions

To start the project, I used the foundation created by Güney to format the project directory structure. I also looked into authentication and implemented authentication handling. I created the art item, sign up and sign in pages without functionality. Then I handled integration of art item page with the endpoints. In addition to the code, I contributed by helping new team members learn about the process.

Code related significant issues:
- [#268 Using Router in Frontend](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/268): Güney had created the initial project files but there was a single route on the app. I used Router to manage more pages. I also changed folder structure of the project directory.
- [#290 Token Handling in the Frontend](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/290): I learned about token handling in React and added token handling to our frontend.
- [#344 Recursion Problem in Art Items ](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/344): I realised that there was a bug in the database usage. The backend team was aware of this issue and I provided some details about the problem.

Management related significant issues:
- [#242 Preparing Questions for the Customer Meeting](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/242) and [#243 Revision of Requirements](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/243): I worked with some of the new members in the team on the revision of requirements. They read the requirements and wrote their questions. I answered these questions and compiled some of their questions with other questions to prepare a question list. I also prepared an action item list for updating the requirements.

### Pull Requests

- [#269](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/pull/269): With this PR, I added the router implemenetation and the new folder structure.
- [#288](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/pull/288): With this PR, I added the static sign-up and sign-in pages.
- [#291](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/pull/291): With this PR, I added token handling to the frontend.
- [#324](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/pull/324): With this PR, we merged the changes we made in the frontend to the develop branch.

### Additional Information

In addition to the work I have done for the milestone, I wanted to learn about annotations and make sure that we will be able to implement them with our current tech stack in the frontend. I did some research, looked into several alternatives and tested them. I was able to verify that some of the tools are applicable and I planned next steps for annotation implementation. Details can be found in [#297](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/297).

### Responsibilities

- I am a member of the mobile team. I worked on research and implementation.

### Main Contributions

Before beginning to implementations, we decided to use Flutter on mobile app since one of the team members knows how to develop mobile apps in Flutter. After everyone in the mobile team learned the basics, we started to divide pages and I got profile page and made a research on [testing Flutter apps](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/wiki/Testing-Flutter-Apps), additionally. After implementing profile page, the first milestone was announced and I got the integration of the login page with backend.
