My name is Erim Erkin Doğan, I am a senior student. My contact information can be found [my personal wiki page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/wiki/Erim-Erkin-Do%C4%9Fan) and weekly updates can be found in my [tracking page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/wiki/Erim-Erkin-Do%C4%9Fan-(Effort-Tracking)).

### Responsibilities
I am a member of frontend team. I worked on setting up infrastructure for our application (docker, deployment, ci/cd) in colloboration with both backend and frontend teams. 

### Main Contributions

I have generally worked on building, testing and researching infrastructure related tasks. I researched about Github ACtions, AWS and its technologies, serving backend and frontend from the same network with domains in mind. I have implemented CI and CD for both backend and frontend applications with Github Actions. I have setup database with AWS's RDS service, while setting automatic deployment with AWS ECS after pushing the built docker image to AWS ECR. For frontend and relaying API from a context path, I have setup NGINX to act as our webserver, serving frontend static files and reverse proxying the API.

As most of my tasks were around setting up initial infrastructure for deployment and testing my contribution to frontend was minimal, implementing the api integration and form validation for login and signup pages were my only contributions.

#### Significant issues:
- [Setting up AWS Deployment & CI/CD [#282]](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/282): This issue is a "mega thread" for infrastructure setup for our application. I have decided on platforms, technologies and setup the infrastructure with them, resulting in a succesful deployment of our application.
- [[Frontend] Revise and connect signup and login to backend [#338]](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/338): Implemented connection between sign-up and sign-in pages of frontend and backend application. Added form validation to sign-up and sign-in pages.

### Pull Requests
- [#276 Dockerization of backend application](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/pull/276): Took over and merged the dockerization of backend from Basak and implemented development and production images. Actively fixed bugs caused by different operating systems or architectures (arm64, amd64) before merging to ensure everyone could run the backend application.
- [#286 Merge docker implementation with frontend branch](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/pull/286): Implemented production and deployment images for frontend application. Created CI with Github Actions.

### Responsibilities

- I am a member of the backend team. I worked on research and implementation, and also debugging. 

### Main Contributions

I started to work on dockerization issue of backend and database. I researched about this topic and started to work on the structure. We finished and concluded this part successfully with Erkin. Before starting the project we decided to use Kotlin with Sprin Boot and MySql. I had no previous experienced with Kotlin. Hence, I researched about it and also took guide from other members of backend team about implementation. After this research and with this guidance, I implemented classes related to sign up/log in functions and home page. Also, implemented one endpoint about art items and a few endpoints to create data to database.

### Responsibilities

- I was the communicator of the team and I was responsible for communications with the TA.
- I am a member of the frontend team. I worked on research and implementation. I handled the token management, setting up the router, adding the art item and event pages.

### Main Contributions

To start the project, I used the foundation created by Güney to format the project directory structure. I also looked into authentication and implemented authentication handling. I created the art item, sign up and sign in pages without functionality. Then I handled integration of art item page with the endpoints. In addition to the code, I contributed by helping new team members learn about the process.

Code related significant issues:
- [#268 Using Router in Frontend](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/268): Güney had created the initial project files but there was a single route on the app. I used Router to manage more pages. I also changed folder structure of the project directory. I also added an art item page with a comment section.
- [#289 Extending Comments component to Cover any User Related Component](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/289): I replaced the comment component I wrote in [#268](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/268) as UserCard to handle comments and user components together. Then I prepared a mock data and rendered this data on the art item page.
- [#290 Token Handling in the Frontend](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/290): I learned about token handling in React and added token handling to our frontend.
- [#343 Art Item Page Endpoint Integration](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/343): I replaced the mock data I had put in the art item page with a fetch request to the API endpoint.
- [#344 Recursion Problem in Art Items ](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/344): I realised that there was a bug in the database usage. The backend team was aware of this issue and I provided some details about the problem.

### Additional Information

In addition to the work I have done for the milestone, I wanted to learn about annotations and make sure that we will be able to implement them with our current tech stack in the frontend. I did some research, looked into several alternatives and tested them. I was able to verify that some of the tools are applicable and I planned next steps for annotation implementation. Details can be found in [#297](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/issues/297).

### Responsibilities

- I am a member of the mobile team. I worked on research and implementation.

### Main Contributions

Before beginning to implementations, we decided to use Flutter on mobile app since one of the team members knows how to develop mobile apps in Flutter. After everyone in the mobile team learned the basics, we started to divide pages and I got profile page and made a research on [testing Flutter apps](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/wiki/Testing-Flutter-Apps), additionally. After implementing profile page, the first milestone was announced and I got the integration of the login page with backend.

## Demet Yayla

### Member
I am Demet Yayla from group 7. We are working on an art platform that unite artists with art-lovers or rather anyone that has something to do related to art. I am on backend team for the product.

### Responsibilities
At the initial weeks, we worked on reviewing design documents and orientation of the group to more implementation-related work. We slightly changed the way we communicated, we decided on platforms and technological tools including languages we are to use. I helped new members of our team to orient with us. I periodically told them about how we proceed with things such as PR reviews, issues, meetings etc. There were four main items to review for design documents: UML class diagram, use case diagram, sequence diagrams, requirements. My partition in them was as follows:
-	I reviewed sequence diagram for discussion forum
-	I reviewed UML Class Diagram with Can Atakan Uğur
Other than that, generally speaking, most of my time spent was on inheritance related issues. During initialization for backend, I wrote initial backend entity classes. I also wrote the initial examples of controllers, initiated repositories. I helped with some bug fixes, searched really a lot on inheritance concept and how relational databases represent those, investigated paradigms. I searched a lot on hibernate annotations for relational database connections. I reviewed code.

# Group Review

## 1. Executive Summary

Ideart. is an art platform where the users can create or visit online galleries and physical exhibitions. It also allows artists to publish their art works, copyright them, and sell them to the art-lovers. Discussion page that users can share their thoughts are also provided.
Our application works on web and mobile both. It is on developing process right now. It supports registration related features such as sign up and log in functions, home page view is partly developed which provides the events and art items information by using the data on our database. Finally, when an event or art item is clicked, the corresponding information page of it is also shown.

Here are the topics that we discussed and decided to change after Customer Milestone 1:
* During the sign up process, optional fields would be deprecated from the page in order to make this process be looked more simple. These optional fields are going to be added to the profile page which is available for the user's usage when they want to provide more information about themselves.
* We were taking age as a personal field, we are going to change it with birthday in order to reduce any update about it and be more consistent.
* Discussion about the time zones that are shown for events: We decided to check whether local time of the user is different than event location time:
    * If they are the same, one time zone shall be shown. If they differ from each other, we shall show both of these time. 
* The location of the events are going to be updated to Geolocation from bare country.

## 3. Status of Deliverables and Impact on Project Plan

### Evaluation of the Status of Deliverables

As mentioned in Section 2, all deliverables were submitted in time. All of them were modified in synchrone, for them to be consistent. We actively updated the situation of each one of them as our project grew gradually. 

Apart from that, all of the deliverables were finalized for Milestone 1 except for the Project Plan. We followed a different implementation scheme to deliver a product that all of its parts are fully integrated with each other for this Milestone. Therefore, we had some significant deviations from our previous plan. More detailed information about this will be provided in the following sub-section.

The evaluation for status of the each deliverable can be seen below.


#### Software Requirements Specification

It was the first deliverable to get finalized and it created a chain reaction of modifications on all other deliverables. After finalizing our Requirements, we updated most of our design documents and indeed, the Project Plan accordingly.


#### Scenario & Mockups

Some features such as maps are removed from mock-ups on a higher level. Payment feature was also removed. 


#### Use-Case Diagram

We revised the diagram and got feedback from the TA. The diagram was ready but we made minor modifications on it before the final update.


#### Class Diagram

We simplified our class structure after eliminating some complicated requirements. The updated Class Diagram is now finalized.


#### Sequence Diagrams

Each member revised their Sequence Diagram and updated it according to our new Requirements and design diagrams. The finalized versions of those are delivered to the customer.


#### Project Plan

We delivered our Project Plan after the revision before Milestone 1. We planned the details week by week and utilized it during our implementation. This version of the Project Plan was delivered to our customer on time.

However, as it will be mentioned in the following sub-section, the status of our deliverables had an impact on our Project Plan; therefore, we will need to update our plan and proceed accordingly.


#### Individual Contribution Reports

Each member filled their own contributions and we submitted it before the decided deadline.

### Deliverables' Impact on the Project Plan


The simplifications on the Requirements and therefore, on the other design and planning documents, of course reduced the workload for each feature. Our Project Plan was mainly planned based on the features to be implemented and since no core feature was removed during the aforementioned elimination process. Therefore, there will be no reduction of features reflected on our Project Plan. 

However, we had a shift in our perception on how long a feature will take. We decided that significant features should not get squezzed to last minue. For example, we decided to move the implementation of Annotations closer since it requires also some understanding of the concept. 

Also, some inordinary situations like the updates in our teams, some members not fulfilling their assigned task and some members being assigned to some extra tasks now requires us to make some minor changes in our resources, too.

We do not expect any other changes unless a customer request pops up requiring modifications on deliverables.



## 4. Evaluation of Tools and Processes


### React & Material UI

We used React library to build our web client. React was easy to configure and it was sufficient for our needs. The hooks API and the context API of React made it easy to manage user tokens and fetch data. In addition to React, we used Material UI (MUI), a component library for React. MUI made it easy to draw components on the page with the functionality we want. It has all kinds of UI tools that make it easy to ship new features.


### Docker
We have used Docker to create development and production images. Docker's common environment for every operating system was helpful for our project since conditions and environment setups of every member was different. Also we didn't need to configure every machine to run the application as the docker images handled most of these tasks for us. We have faced some bugs while trying to setup docker containers in ARM based (M1 variant macbooks) computers. One of the bugs was specially present in Docker-compose as the parser couldn't recognize some configuration parameters when the other members could run the containers without any problem. 


### AWS
AWS was used to deploy our application. When creating our infrastructure for the application we have benefited from the vast selection of solutions of AWS provided with its Free Tier. With these technologies we were able to automate the deployment of our application in unison with Github Actions. The only complaint of ours about AWS is also its pro, in which the detail of configuration and vast number of choices made initial configuration and understanding hard for a new user.


### Github Actions

We have used Github Actions to create automated testing, building and publishing workflows for our applications. While the setup process was tough as we didn't have a way to test the implementation on a local environment, resulting in numerous hotfixes in the codes or workflow configurations but in the end the results were convincing. We will now be able to automate the testing steps for every pull request before merging, checking if there is any problem in new changes. Also implementation of automated deployment to AWS ensures that every member of the team could deploy the application in need with a click without knowing the infrastructure and needs of the application.

### Flutter

We have used Flutter framework for developing our mobile application. Dart language is used for developing Flutter apps and Dart is very similar to Java. Since we all used Java in our school courses, getting used to Dart was fairly easy. The reason we chose Flutter over Kotlin is because Flutter provides easier and faster development with many libraries. Also Flutter has a hot reload feature which allows observing changes in code without rebuilding the app. This feature allowed us to develop faster than native Kotlin development. All in all, we were satisfied with our experience with Flutter.

### Kotlin & Spring Boot 

We have initialized our backend with Kotlin and Spring Boot. The main reason why we chose these is that most of the backend team members have experience with them. Also Spring Boot offers a lot of flexible solutions to our needs. For example we used Spring Security in our authentication part and Sprring Boot ORM to manage our MySQL database.

### Postman

It offers user-friendly interface to send HTTP requests to test the APIs' functionatilities. It is possible to add headers in the request. It also allow the user to select different body types. The main advantge is the abililty to save a configuration. There is no need to fill every field of a request every time. Save option reduces the hassle

### MySQL Workbench

It is a visual database design tool that enables SQL development, administration, database design, creation and maintenance into a single integrated development environment. We mainly used this to check if everything is going smoothly in our database. We can also reach to the database from our backend code but checking from MySQL Workbench provides different point of view other than the code itself. It is easier to detect the flaws.
