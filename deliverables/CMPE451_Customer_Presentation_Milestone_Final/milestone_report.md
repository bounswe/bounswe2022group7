## 1.6. Annotations
We have implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with our web annotations web service. Since web annotations are json-ld documents, we used MongoDB as the database and implemented a minimal web service with the Koa framework on top of it. We return an identifier for the newly created annotations in the ETag response header. Our web client supports creating image and text annotations. Although we don't fully implemented every possible way to annotate web resources, the parts that are implemented are sufficient for our users to effectively benefit in their daily uses of the platform.

In order to create an image annotation, the web client allows users to select and identify a portion of the image and sends a post request with the resulting json-ld document to the /annotations/ endpoint. Similarly, for annotation a portion of a text, the user highlights the portion they want to annotate, and the web client sends the resulting annotation document to the /annotations/ endpoint.

Different type of annotations and different type of contents that are being annotated are differentiated by prepending the type and the id of the content to the annotation id with a dash character ('-') separating the two, so that the same endpoint (/annotations/{content-id} where {content-id} is the id of the content being annotated) can be used to retrieve the relevant annotation documents for different content types. For example, e23-afb445...76 represents a text annotation made on the description of an event. Image annotations don't have a letter at the beginning that indicates the type of the content being annotated. Ids of other type of annotations (all of which are text annotations) start with the first letter of the content type being annotated (a: art item, e: event, d: discussion post).
## 1.7. Standards
[The W3 Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) standard precisely describes what web annotations are and includes clear examples of various ways they can be represented and modelled. In order not to reinvent the wheel, we used an existing library that complies with the W3 standard, called [Recogito](https://github.com/recogito/recogito-js). Using this library in our implementation of annotations in the web client of our app helped us tremendously in that it is used by many people and thus tested extensively. This way we delivered a standards-compliant web implementation of Web Annotation Data Model in a faster and more stable way.

### System Manual
#### Mobile
- System Requirements:

This application only runs on Android devices and requires Android 5.0 or higher.

- Installation Instructions:

You must have the latest stable Flutter version and Android Studio installed in order to build the application.

Follow the instructions at https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install to install Flutter and set up your development environment. Furthermore, instructions on how to install Android Studio can be found at https://developer.android.com/studio/install.

To run your Flutter app on an emulator, you'll need to install an emulator. There are a variety of options available, such as the Android Emulator that comes with Android Studio, or third-party emulators like Genymotion. Follow the instructions at https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator to setup the Android Emulator in Android Studio.

After installing the emulator, you can download the dependencies and run the app from the terminal or via user interface in Android Studio.

To build from the terminal run:
```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

To build using Android Studio interface:
1. Open pubspec.yaml file and click on "pub get" button
2. Press the green run button at the top or press Shift + F10.

### Member
I am a member of the frontend team. You can find my weekly contributions on my [effort page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group7/wiki/G%C3%BCney-%C4%B0zol-(Effort-Tracking)).

### Responsibilities
I have worked on frontend development infrastructure and implementation of the home page. I also worked on both the backend and frontend implementation of web annotation features of our project. I researched about the web annotation standard and read the standard's documents. 

### Main Contributions
